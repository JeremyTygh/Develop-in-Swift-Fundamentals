### Apple Pie Game
###### A simple word-guessing game, in which each player has a limited number of turns to guess the letters in a word. Each incorrect guess results in an apple falling off the tree. The player wins by guessing the word correctly before all the apples are gone. 
###### Intended as an exercise in utilizing the mechanisms provided by the UIKit framework for managing the flow of the app. Also serves as a review of the mangaement of the position and size of views and controls using Auto Layout and stack views.

### Personality Quiz
###### A personality quiz where players are presented with a light-hearted topic and answer questions that align them to a particular outcome. In this instance, players answer questions to answer the question: "Which animal are you?". 
###### Intended as an exercise in the basics of UIKit, the foundation of iOS development. Serves as practice for displaying simple information with views, and responding to user input with a variety of controls.
